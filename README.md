Understanding how people think, feel, or behave in specific situations, and how they interact and organize to influence the world around them is critical to building effective public health systems.

In the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, our research explores how social systems, community values, historic inequities, and psychological states affect public health policies, programs, and outcomes. We often collaborate with community members in their neighborhoods, workplaces and recreational spaces, to identify priority health concerns and to develop potential solutions, and are uniquely focused on mental and behavioral aspects of public health systems research in preparedness and emergency response.
